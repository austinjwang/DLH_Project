    "Modern machine learning algorithms can extract relevant features from medical data and make predictions for previously unseen patients. Current deep learning architectures used for risk prediction, based on Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data generally employ attention layers on top of recurrent layers. The models allow for state-of-the-art predictions and have enhanced interpretability by virtue of using Attention models. However, they fall short on processing time-series data (diagnosis codes and procedure codes in EMR) that was sampled at irregular time intervals. Predictive accuracy was comparable across neural network architectures. Groups of patients suffering from infectious complications, with chronic or progressive conditions, and for whom standard medical care was not suitable. Attention-based networks may be preferable to recurrent networks if an interpretable model is required, at only marginal cost in predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Paper explanation\n",
    "The paper our project was based on proposed evaluating different deep learning architectures for predicting ICU readmission and describing patients at risk. The innovation of the method lies in its comparison of various deep learning architectures. This approach goes beyond traditional machine learning methods and explores the potential of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in healthcare analytics. Model performance was gauged using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. The effectiveness of the method would depend on how well it performed compared to the baseline models or existing clinical scoring systems in predicting ICU readmissions and providing interpretable insights into patient risk factors. The contribution of the research lies in its exploration of advanced deep learning techniques in a critical healthcare domain. By benchmarking and comparing different architectures, the paper provides valuable insights into the potential of deep learning for improving predictive accuracy and interpretability in ICU readmission prediction, thereby contributing to the ongoing research in healthcare analytics and patient care optimization.  The paper also concluded that several different models were viable with no one approach being by far the best, and choosing a model could depend on factors such as the need for interpretability of results."

    "# Scope of Reproducibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis of the paper is below:\n",
    "*   The utilization of various deep learning architectures, including LSTM, CNN, and Transformer models, will lead to improved accuracy in predicting readmission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and provide valuable insights into identifying patients-at-risk compared to traditional machine learning methods or clinical scoring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to explore different approaches to time embeddings (MCE with time aware attention, embedding layers with concatenated elapsed times and embedding layers + neural ODE’s), across different deep learning architecture combinations. Our project is based on an existing study that concluded Neural ODEs applied to code embeddings did generally resulted in improved performance, suggesting that they may constitute a building block of interest for neural networks processing not only continuous time series, but also timestamped codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would assume that the conclusion in the study holds true and through our implementation of the models attempt to prove that out.  From a computational perspective, the size of the MIMIC III tables involved and runtime of the scripts lead us to believe that these results can be reproduced using personal computers without the need for external memory or computational power.\n"

The preprocessing functions are shown in the Preprocessing Code section below. In addition to the MIMIC III tables listed above, the preprocessing functions also generate intermediate data files that can be used in later preprocessing steps that will ultimately lead to constructing the training/testing data arrays.  The implementation for the preprocessing code largely reuses the preprocessing code provided in the GitHub repo of the original paper (https://github.com/sebbarb/time_aware_attention), with some additional comments added and small fixes due to package and python versioning.\n",

    "According to our paper, the paper's results indicate that the deep learning architectures, particularly those with a recurrent component, outperformed the logistic regression baseline model in predicting ICU readmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline Characteristics: The analysis involved 23 static variables, 992 unique ICD-9 diagnosis codes, 298 unique ICD-9 procedure codes, 586 unique medications, and 32 codes related to vital signs. Each patient's electronic medical record (EMR) contained a maximum of 552 ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure codes and 392 medications and vital sign codes associated with the current ICU stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Trends: Models with a recurrent component generally performed better (average precision range: 0.298–0.331) than those based solely on attention layers (average precision range: 0.269–0.294). This suggests that incorporating recurrent neural network (RNN) components improved the predictive power for ICU readmissions.\n",
